### fastai
I have started with the fastai course on 29 June 2023 and I want to track my progress. The initial notebooks (maybe first 3) have little modifications in them as I'm getting familiar with the library. The later notebooks will contain lots of changes than the provided code, and each and every word/function will be explained in sipmle words in markdown. 

My aim with this course is to get comfortable with DL and I will test this comfortability by creating cool, unique projects from scratch.

### Folders
